# Brainstorm

we've decided to make an turn based online game named : **Border Wars**

## Building list

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Buildings))
    ("Castle</br>
    The main building of your army, you must protect it")
    ("Casern</br>
      Train troop")
    ("Tower</br>
      Defend your territory")
    ("Wall</br>
    A pasive defence that block every soldier")
    ("Outpost</br>
    A *teleporter* like")
    [Farms]
      ("Mine</br>
      Allow you to gain stone each turns")
      ("Sawmill</br>
      Allow you to gain wood each turns")
      ("Breeding</br>
      Allow you to gain food each turn")
```

## Game Modes

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Game Modes))
    ("1v1</br>
    The classic mode")
    ("2v2</br>
    A funny mode 2v2")
    ("History mode</br>
    A mode to understand why")
    ("1vIA ?</br>
    A when you don't have friends")
```


## Style 

We think to made our game in 2D iso with hexagons.
the overall theme will be fairytale medieval.

## Different troop 


```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Troop))
    ("No Name</br>
    A classic troop")
    ("No Name</br>
    A troop with a great deal of experience but not much power")
    ("No Name</br>
    A troop with great power but little scope for expansion")
```

## Balancing

In the future, we'll have to make sure that each troop is both different and balanced.
