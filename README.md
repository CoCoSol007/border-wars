# Border Wars

## Brainstorm 

If you want to know more about our reflexions check this : [all brainstorms](docs/brainstorms/).



## The game

we've decided to make an turn based online game named : **Border Wars**

Code in rust using Bevy 

## Building list

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Buildings))
    ("`**Castle**
    The main building of your army, you must protect it`")
    ("`**Casern**
      Train troop`")
    ("`**Tower**
      Defend your territory`")
    ("`**Wall**
    A pasive defence that block every soldier`")
    ("`**Outpost**
    A *teleporter* like`")
    [**Farms**]
      ("`**Mine**
      Allow you to gain stone each turns`")
      ("`**Sawmill**
      Allow you to gain wood each turns`")
      ("`**Breeding**
      Allow you to gain food each turn`")
```

## Game Modes

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Game Modes))
    ("`**1v1**
    The classic mode`")
    ("`**2v2**
    A funny mode 2v2`")
    ("`**History mode**
    A mode to understand why`")
    ("`**1vIA**?
    A when you don't have friends`")
```


## Style 

We think to made our game in 2D iso with hexagons.
the overall theme will be fairytale medieval.

## Different troop 


```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Troop))
    ("`**No Name**
    A classic troop`")
    ("`**No Name**
    A troop with a great deal of experience but not much power`")
    ("`**No Name**
    A troop with great power but little scope for expansion`")
```

## Balancing

In the future, we'll have to make sure that each troop is both different and balanced.
