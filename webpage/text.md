# What is Border Wars?
Border Wars is an online, turn-based strategy game where players compete to conquer territories and expand their medieval kingdom. The game features a cartoon-style map and an online multiplayer mode, making it both fun and challenging.

# How it works ?
Border Wars is an open source project. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/CoCoSol007/border-wars). For this project, we chose to use a full code game engine [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org), written in Rust, instead of Unity or Godot. When people ask, "Why? I say, "Because we like to challenge ourselves".

# How to play ?
